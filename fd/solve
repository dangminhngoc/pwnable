Learn about file descriptor -> a number identify an open file in the system
0 => input stream
1 => output stream
2 => error stream

```
    int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234;
	int len = 0;
	len = read(fd, buf, 32);
```

To solve this, input the value so that fd == 0, which means we will be reading 
data from input stream into buf. Call `./fd 4660 1` and then the program will 
wait for your input.

Check the condition in this loc
```
if(!strcmp("LETMEWIN\n", buf)){
```
and we can determine after the input stream is open, we need to enter `LETMEWIN\n`.
The condition will now satisfied and this program will read the flag from flag file for us.
